# Adversarial-Data-Encryption

PyTorch implementation of paper "Adversarial Attack for Data Encryption".

Our implementation is based on these repositories:

- [robustness](https://github.com/MadryLab/robustness)

- [CIFAR-ZOO](https://github.com/BIGBALLON/CIFAR-ZOO)

### Abstract

In the big data era, many organizations face the dilemma of data sharing. Regular data sharing is often necessary  for human-centered discussion and communication, especially in medical scenarios. 
However, unprotected data sharing may also lead to  data leakage. Inspired by adversarial attack, 
we propose a method for data encryption, so that for human beings the encrypted data look identical to the original version,  but for machine learning methods they are misleading.
